## Executive Summary

This document defines the GitHub repository architecture, branching strategy, security configuration, and collaboration workflows for our headless WordPress + Next.js enterprise solution. The architecture prioritizes security, collaboration, and automated quality assurance while maintaining development velocity.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Branching Strategy**: GitFlow with environment-specific branches
- **Security**: Branch protection, required reviews, automated security scanning
- **Automation**: Comprehensive CI/CD with quality gates
- **Collaboration**: Templates, labels, and workflows for efficient team collaboration

## Branching Strategy

### GitFlow Implementation

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Setup"
    
    branch feature/auth-system
    checkout feature/auth-system
    commit id: "Auth: JWT setup"
    commit id: "Auth: Login flow"
    checkout develop
    merge feature/auth-system
    
    branch release/v1.0
    checkout release/v1.0
    commit id: "v1.0-rc1"
    commit id: "Bug fixes"
    checkout main
    merge release/v1.0
    commit id: "v1.0 Release" tag: "v1.0"
    
    checkout develop
    merge main
    
    checkout main
    branch hotfix/critical-bug
    checkout hotfix/critical-bug
    commit id: "Critical fix"
    checkout main
    merge hotfix/critical-bug
    commit id: "v1.0.1" tag: "v1.0.1"
    
    checkout develop
    merge main
```

### Branch Definitions

#### Main Branches

**1. `main`** (Production)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Protection**: Maximum protection with required reviews
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploy to production environment
- **Access**: Maintainers only
- **Merge Policy**: Only from `release/*` and `hotfix/*` branches

**2. `develop`** (Development Integration)
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for active development
- **Protection**: Required reviews and status checks
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploy to development environment
- **Access**: Developers with write access
- **Merge Policy**: From `feature/*` branches via PRs

**3. `staging`** (Staging Environment)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **Protection**: Required reviews and automated testing
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploy to staging environment
- **Access**: Developers and QA team
- **Merge Policy**: From `develop` branch when ready for staging

#### Supporting Branches

**Feature Branches**: `feature/<ticket-number>-<short-description>`
```
feature/PROJ-123-user-authentication
feature/PROJ-456-graphql-optimization
feature/PROJ-789-azure-deployment
```

**Release Branches**: `release/v<major>.<minor>`
```
release/v1.0
release/v1.1
release/v2.0
```

**Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<description>`
```
hotfix/v1.0.1-security-patch
hotfix/v1.0.2-critical-bug-fix
```

## Best Practices and Guidelines

### Commit Message Convention

```
type(scope): subject

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes

#### Examples
```
feat(frontend): add user authentication flow

Implement JWT-based authentication with login/logout functionality.
Includes form validation and error handling.

Closes #123

---

fix(backend): resolve GraphQL query timeout issue

Optimize database queries to prevent timeout on large datasets.
Add query complexity analysis to prevent expensive operations.

Fixes #456

---

docs(architecture): update deployment guide

Add Azure-specific deployment instructions and troubleshooting section.
```

### Code Review Guidelines

#### Review Criteria
```yaml
Functionality:
  - [ ] Code works as intended
  - [ ] Edge cases handled
  - [ ] Error handling implemented
  - [ ] Business requirements met

Code Quality:
  - [ ] Follows project conventions
  - [ ] Well-structured and readable
  - [ ] Appropriate comments
  - [ ] No code duplication
  - [ ] Performance considerations

Security:
  - [ ] No security vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Input validation present
  - [ ] Authentication/authorization correct
  - [ ] No sensitive data exposure

Testing:
  - [ ] Adequate test coverage
  - [ ] Tests are meaningful
  - [ ] All tests passing
  - [ ] Manual testing performed

Documentation:
  - [ ] README updated if needed
  - [ ] API documentation updated
  - [ ] Comments explain complex logic
  - [ ] Breaking changes documented
```

#### Review Process
1. **Self-Review**: Author reviews own code before submission
2. **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipeline validates code quality
3. **Peer Review**: At least one team member reviews
4. **Technical Review**: Senior developer/architect for complex changes
5. **Final Approval**: Code owner or maintainer approval
6. **Merge**: Automated merge after all approvals
