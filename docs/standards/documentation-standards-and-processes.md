## Documentation Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Local-First Development**
   - Git repository is the single source of truth
   - All documentation written in Markdown
   - Version controlled alongside code
   - Confluence serves as collaboration hub

2. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Focus on essential, actionable documentation
   - Regular review and pruning of outdated content
   - User-centered approach to content creation

3. **Consistency & Standards**
   - Standardized templates and formats
   - Consistent terminology and style
   - Automated quality checks

4. **Accessibility & Inclusion**
   - Clear, simple language
   - Multiple content formats (text, video, diagrams)
   - Inclusive language guidelines
